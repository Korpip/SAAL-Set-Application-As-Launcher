# SAAL-Set-Application-As-Launcher
 Many moons ago I used an application called "Target Home Launcher" and wanted to use it again with HomeAssistant. It was no longer on the play store. So I decided to create it myself by copy pasting only the best code on the internet that I could find.


I used sites like these to build it.

Get list of installed applications

First result to identify the application as a launcher came.uonwith this link
